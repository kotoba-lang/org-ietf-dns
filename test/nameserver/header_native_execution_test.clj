;; Does `header_core.kotoba` RUN, and does it answer correctly?
;;
;; The parity suite next door answers "does the KIR interpreter agree with
;; nameserver.wire". This one signs the artifact, measures the runtime, builds
;; a loader and executes machine code on this CPU.
;;
;; What it asks about is `accept-reply?`, because that is the decision with a
;; consequence: a resolver that skips the id or the QR bit believes any UDP
;; datagram reaching its port, which is off-path cache poisoning with nothing
;; forged. All three of its conditions are exercised -- one accepting case and
;; one rejecting case per condition -- so a native build that dropped any of
;; them changes the number.
;;
;; It FAILS rather than skips when it cannot run. A native-execution test that
;; passes where nothing executed reports the strongest claim in the repository
;; on the strength of having done nothing.
;;
;; The packing multiplies rather than shifting. This module already contains
;; shifts, so introducing a :bool parameter or another shift-family operation
;; in the entry point risks the pair the native target refuses (amu#611);
;; multiplication by powers of two is the same packing without it.
