;; `kotoba/nameserver/header_core.kotoba` against `nameserver.wire`.

;; The object exists so a machine resolving its own names -- an aiueos node
;; with no JVM and no Node -- decides for itself whether to believe a reply.
;; It cannot call this namespace, so nothing but this notices them drifting.
;;
;; `accept-reply?` is the part that matters. A resolver that skips the id or
;; the QR bit believes any UDP datagram that reaches its port, which is
;; off-path cache poisoning with nothing forged. So the suite drives all three
;; of its conditions independently rather than only the case where everything
;; is right, and each one is separately broken in the discrimination pass.
