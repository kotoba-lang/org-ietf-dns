  "EDNS(0) — RFC 6891 — as an interpretation layer over `nameserver.wire`.

  EDNS0 is not a new message format. It is one pseudo-RR in the additional
  section that overloads fields the RR header already has, and that overloading
  is where implementations go wrong:

  | RR field | in an OPT RR it means |
  |---|---|
  | NAME | must be root (`\".\"`), and nothing else |
  | TYPE | 41 |
  | **CLASS** | the sender's **maximum UDP payload size**, not a class |
  | **TTL** | extended-RCODE (high 8 bits), EDNS version, DO flag, Z |
  | RDATA | a sequence of `{code, length, data}` options |

  So an OPT RR read as an ordinary RR says the class is `CLASS4096` and the TTL
  is 32768 — both meaningless, both silently plausible. This namespace reads
  those fields as what they are and leaves `wire` alone.

  ## Why this matters beyond \"bigger packets\"

  Without EDNS0 a response body is capped at 512 octets and anything larger is
  truncated with the TC bit, forcing the client to retry over TCP. That is
  merely slow for a big answer set — and **fatal** for DNSSEC, where a single
  signed response routinely exceeds 512 octets, so a signed zone served without
  EDNS0 pushes every query to TCP. EDNS0 is therefore a prerequisite for
  `org-ietf-dnssec`, not an optimization.

  ## The extended RCODE trap

  RCODE is 4 bits in the header and 12 bits with EDNS0: the OPT TTL carries the
  **high 8**, the header carries the low 4. Writing a 16-bit rcode into the
  header alone silently truncates — `BADVERS` (16) becomes 0, so a version
  negotiation failure is reported as success. `split-rcode` and `join-rcode`
  keep the two halves together.

  A server that receives an OPT with a version it does not support must answer
  **BADVERS with its own OPT attached** (RFC 6891 §6.1.3), not FORMERR: the
  client has to learn which version the server speaks, and a FORMERR does not
  tell it."
