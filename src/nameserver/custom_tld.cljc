(ns nameserver.custom-tld
  "Alt-root custom-TLD resolver (e.g. a made-up `.hogehoge`) bridging DNS
  queries to kotoba-lang's key-derived IPNS self-sovereign names (ipns.core)
  via the dnslink convention (https://dnslink.io).

  This is NOT a claim of global ICANN-root resolvability — nobody can grant
  that for a made-up TLD; the model is the same 'alt-root' reality as
  Handshake/ENS-via-gateway/OpenNIC. What it gives you: anyone who points a
  stub resolver, a browser extension, or this nameserver's own clients at
  this server gets `.hogehoge` names that resolve to whatever IPNS
  key-derived content the label names. No registrar and no owner hand-off
  are needed to mint one, because holding the Ed25519 private key already
  IS authority over that name (ipns.core's docstring) — this resolver only
  recognizes a syntactically valid key-derived label and answers with its
  dnslink; it does not itself speak libp2p/IPNS routing (out of scope, same
  as ipns.core's own documented non-scope: 'Not in scope: publishing/
  resolving IPNS records over the network')."
